                    all studio members play through excerpts for a blind pannel, usually just Prof Wu. 
                    Prof Wu uses your pools performance and existing knowledge of your playing to decide 
                    your ensemble for the quarter.</li>
                <li><name>Pools pools</name><br> - Where studio members bet on which excerpts will be called during the pool audition.

                    Typically, Prof Wu and studio members offer feedback on the performance. 
                    Playing in studio massively decreases performance nerves and improves your musicianship, 
                    so take advantage of this early on! </li>
                <li><name>Studio dinner</name><br> - Towards the end of each quarter, Prof Wu takes everyone in the studio to enjoy a meal together. 
                    The atmosphere is very casual.</li>
